| Fun01: get_diCoords
|   - gets start and ending coordinates for DI events
| Input:
|   - samSTPtr:
|     o pointer to samEntry struct with sequencer to scan
|   - minDILenUI:
|     o minimum deletion length to classify cigar entry as
|       a DI entry
|   - minEndNtUI:
|     o how many bases in a DI event must be to be a DI
|       event
|   - diStartAryUI:
|     o pointer to unsigned long to hold the starting
|       coordinates of each DI event
|   - diEndAryUI:
|     o pointer to unsigned long to hold the ending
|       coordinates of each DI event
|   - lenArysUIPtr:
|     o pointer to unsigned long to hold diStartAryUI and
|       diEndAryUI lengths
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o diStartAryUI to have DI starting coordinates
|     o diEndAryUI to have DI ending coordinates
|     o lenArysUIPtr to have new array lengths if
|       diStartAryUI and diEndAryUI are changed
|   - Returns:
|     o number of DI events detected
|     o < 0 for memory errors
