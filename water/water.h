| Fun06: water
|   - run a Waterman Smith alignment on input sequences
| Input:
|   - qrySTPtr:
|     o pointer to seqST with query sequence 
|       - qrySTPtr->offsetUL; first query base to align
|       - qrySTPtr->endAlnUL; last query base to align
|   - refSTPtr:
|     o pointer to seqST with reference sequence 
|       - refSTPtr->offsetUL; 1st reference base to align
|       - refSTPtr->endAlnUL; last reference base to align
|   - matrixSTPtr:
|     o pointer to dirMatrix to use for the alingment
|   - alnSet:
|     o pointer to alnSet with alignment settings
| Output:
|  - Modifies:
|    o allocates memory for dirMatrixSC and scoreAryUL
|      if they are to small
|    o updates lenMatrixUL and lenScoreUL if dirMatrixSC
|      or scoreAryUL are resized
|  - Returns:
|    o 0 for memory error
|    o score for alignment
