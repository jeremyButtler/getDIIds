| Fun03: ifDelim_ulCp
|   - Detect if the input deliminator is in the input

|   - SAFE_DELIM uses 9 to 8 OP for 64 bit, 7 to 6 OP for

|     depends on if the deliminator is hardcoded or not.
|   - ifndef SAFE_DELIM takes 5 op no matter what your
|     OS type is. You could reduce it down by removing the
|     (addUL & 1) + addUL step, but this does cause some
|     issues with values that are one off the actual. Tab
|     is safe, since it is odd, but not comma or space.
| Input:
|   - strUL:
|     o Unsigned long to check for the delimintor in
|   - delimUL:
|     o Unsinged long with delimintor (use ulMakeDelim
