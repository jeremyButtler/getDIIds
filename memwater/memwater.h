| Fun06: memwater
|   - Performs a memory efficent Smith Waterman alignment
|     on a pair of sequences
| Input;
|   - qrySeqSTVoidPtr:
|     o Point to an seqST with the query sequence and
|       index 0 coordinates to start (offsetUL)/end
|       (endAlnUL) the alignment.
|   - refSeqSTVoidPtr:
|     o Point to an seqST with the reference sequence
|       and index 0 coordinates to start (offsetUL)/end
|       (endAlnUL) the alignment.
|   - refStartUL:
|     o Pointer to unsigned long to hold the frist
|       reference base in the alignment
|   - refEndUL:
|     o Pointer to unsigned long to hold the last
|       reference base in the alignment
|   - qryStartUL:
|     o Pointer to unsigned long to hold the frist query 
|       base in the alignment
|   - qryEndUL:
|     o Pointer to unsigned long to hold the last query
|       base in the alignment
|   - alnSetVoidPtr:
|     o Pointer to an alnSet structure with the gap open,
|       gap extend, and scoring matrix for the alingment
| Output:
|  - Modifies:
|    o refStartUL to have 1st reference base in alignment
|    o refEndUL to have last reference base in alignment
|    o qryStartUL to have first query base in alignment
|    o qryEndUL to have last query base in alignment
|  - Returns:
|    o Score for aligment
|    o 0 for memory errors
